## Our Mission

React Handbook is for web developers building React applications to quickly digest the React ecosystem and learn what they need to. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## "What they need to?" {{ anchor: false }}

That's right. Think of this website as a collection of best practices and widely used libraries that you can depend on for your applications. The main point is to help web developers learn/research only what they need to learn while building React applications. Maybe that's the whole kitchen sink, maybe that's just a particular subject like writing unit tests. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Another React course? {{ anchor: false }}

This isn't really meant to be a course that you start and finish... It's a bookmark, meant to point you in the right direction when you encounter something in the React ecosystem that you'd like to learn more about.

I want to help you avoid spending countless hours wondering through stale, low-effort, and sometimes outright *wrong* articles/videos/courses.

My goal is by using this site, you'll spend less time searching the internet for good learning resources and instead spend more time shipping your React applications in a way that will scale.
