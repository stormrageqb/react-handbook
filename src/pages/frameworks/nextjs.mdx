## Why do people like using Next.js?

This <Resource url='https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/zprham/why_do_people_like_using_nextjs/'>reddit thread</Resource> is the inspiration for this section, and I'm going to summarize some of the responses here:

1. The first and most upvoted response is one that appreciates the ease of maintenance in a project that supports Server-Side React rendering. It's not that the setup is hard - it's that the APIs and planning haven't all settled just yet and therefore as new updates get pushed and the features move along - maintenance and upkeep becomes a challenge.
2. General consensus that the Next.js <Resource url='https://nextjs.org/docs'>documentation</Resource> is good
3. It's easy to make frontend devs a bit closer to "full-stack" by expanding what is possible in a React framework
4. The NEED for Server-Side rendering in an application/organization where everyone already knows React well is a great fit (teams are productive quickly)
