## ðŸ‘‹ Hey, web devs

If you want to build web applications with React, this guide will get you there.

We only author a little original content ourselves, but we have worked to find the highest quality material to build this guide.

What we'll cover here is typically high-level, the basics, or only a preview of what you can expect when working with a feature/library. After exposing you to the basics, we'll provide links to other writers/material to explain the in-depth concepts you need to learn.

It may be hard to avoid arguments over ideologies, clashes in opinions, or disagreements of philosophy, but we'll keep this civil! The main idea is to surface the best ideas.

## TypeScript

A JavaScript developer can pick up the basics of TypeScript in about 10 minutes. But I want to stress that learning TS is more than just adding "types" to your variables here and there. It's about removing the possibility of an entire class of (common) bugs you'll likely run into if you wrote an application in pure JavaScript. It's likely you already have an internal mental model of "data structures" when you're coding in JavaScript - TypeScript just solidifies those mental models (in your head) into actual "rules" that can apply to your code and how it gets used.

The class of bugs you're getting rid of are all those pesky (â€¦cannot readâ€¦ 'undefined') errors in the console. If you're ready to get started, check out some of the links below:

- **[TS for the New Programmer](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-from-scratch.html)** - TypeScript explained (in the official documentation) for beginners
- **[Beginner's TypeScript](https://www.totaltypescript.com/tutorials/beginners-typescript)** - A (free) interactive video tutorial to learn the foundations of TypeScript by Matt Pocock

It is not an exaggeration to call TypeScript an entire programming language, but even the simplest TypeScript can compile to JS. So the good news is you can adopt complexity only as it aids you. Sometimes you might have to temporarily level up or step outside your level of expertise to complete a feature. For example, if a library gives you code to work with and it's more advanced TS than you can ordinarily write, thats acceptable to use it. But in most cases, it's effortless to adopt it in your JS projects and code incrementally.

Again, we recommend TypeScript and will create most code samples in our guides with valid TS code - but you can do what you want.

## Why React?

At the core of React is an ideal I strive for when creating software: *simplicity*. While there are some not-so-simple concepts to learn before truly mastering React as a tool, IMO, it is the most straightforward API available today that helps web engineers build UIs.

Many developers might claim React's simplicity (or flexibility) makes it ripe for misuse and leads to spaghetti-filled codebases (especially on large teams).

This may be a valid critique. I've seen some bad code in my days as an engineer.

And maybe some people aren't wrong when they say, "A more opinionated and rigid framework like Angular gives less room for chaotic code and provides guardrails to the team".

But even acknowledging all that - in my eight years building for the web, my most memorable & delightful work experiences were on applications built with React. It made building UIs and frontends so much fun and simple. I want to help other engineering teams feel that same delight when working on their React codebase.

## React Basics

To give you a quick idea of the current state of React, check out this 2-minute clip by Fireship titled **[React in 100 Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn6-PIqc4UM)**. While it barely scratches the surface, it quickly communicates why React is so popular today (an important context to keep in mind).

Before diving into React, you should have a pretty solid grasp of these technologies:

**Fundamentals you'll need:**

***Events*** drive interactivity in web applications. Understanding events at their core and how they propagate through the DOM (in the correct hierarchy and order) is critical to understanding browser behavior. To understand events, you should start by reading **[An Interactive Guide to JavaScript Events](https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/blog/interactive-guide-to-javascript-events/)** by Aleksandr Hovhannisyan.

**[Asynchronous JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous)** allows us to write UIs and apps with non-blocking interactivity. At the same time, potentially long-running processes run in the background, which helps us defer behavior until those processes have been completed. [Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Promises) are the primary way of dealing with asynchronous processes and the information carried.

Arrays have developed as of es6 and now provide rich means of manipulating data and information streams. Read more about the functions of **[Arrays in JavaScript](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/complete-introduction-to-the-most-useful-javascript-array-methods/)**.

**Learning React Basics:**

The React API, especially JSX, is a **[declarative](https://ui.dev/imperative-vs-declarative-programming)** way to describe our UI. React allows us to ignore the messiness of browser DOM APIs for rendering our apps (or mobile rendering in the case of react-native). You're [really](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx) going to [want](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/javascript-in-jsx-with-curly-braces) to know [JSX](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/react-101/modules/react-101-jsx-u/cheatsheet).

Some specific articles you might devote some extra time and thought to digest in the React Docs are:

- [Thinking in React](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/thinking-in-react)
- [Responding to Events](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/responding-to-events) (clicking, typing, etc.)
- [Describing the UI](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/describing-the-ui)
- [Managing State](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/managing-state) (components)
- [Built-In React Hooks](https://beta.reactjs.org/reference/react)
    - [A Complete Guide to useEffect](https://overreacted.io/a-complete-guide-to-useeffect/) - a very detailed article on the nuance of useEffect by core-team member Dan Abramov
    - [Myths about useEffect](https://epicreact.dev/myths-about-useeffect/)
- [Escape Hatches](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/escape-hatches)
- [Rendering in React](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/render-and-commit)
