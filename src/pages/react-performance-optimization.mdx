# React Performance & Optimization

Performance in React apps can be thought of in ***2 ways***:

1. Loading Performance - Compressing &amp; loading code/assets (mostly *Non-React* things)
2. Runtime Performance - CPU &amp; rendering issues (mostly *React-specific* things)

## Loading vs. Runtime

Loading Performance - This is a measure of how fast the content is loaded when a user visits your webpage. Some specific metrics are First Contentful Paint (FCP), Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), First Input Delay (FID), TTI (Time to Interactive), and maybe a "Speed Index".

Runtime Performance - This is a measure of how "smooth" your application runs and functions after the initial load. Some specific metrics for this might be "frame rate", "CPU", and "Memory Usage".

	- Optimize all <Resource url='https://kinsta.com/blog/optimize-images-for-web/'>images</Resource> and <Resource url='https://www.keycdn.com/blog/video-optimization'>videos</Resource> included in the bundle
		- Lazy load <Resource url='https://web.dev/browser-level-image-lazy-loading/'>images</Resource>

	- <Resource url='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfLFHp7Sbkg'>Server-Side Rendering (SSR)</Resource> and <Resource url='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfLFHp7Sbkg'>Static Site Generation (SSG)</Resource> can improve the First Contentful Paint and Time to Interactive metrics, as they allow the browser to render the page more quickly (and are accessible by search engines).
		- Adding SSR / SSG to an existing project is no small feat and will take you more than an afternoon. Try to evaluate early on if your application would benefit from these technologies so you can configure your project the right way from the start.

## Measuring Runtimes

Modern React is pretty fast by default. Unless you're building complex components/features - you don't need to reach for optimization tactics until you notice a component/feature behaving slowly. The best advice to follow:

1. Don't optimize too soon 
2. Know what to measure 

In modern React apps, most of the performance issues you'll run into can probably be simplified down to rendering problems (either too slow, or too much). The visual in the tweet below explains how rendering can cause cascading effects across a large application.

## Optimizing Runtimes

Runtime performance issues usually boil down to two types of issues:

1. Fixing Slow Renders 
	- <Resource url='https://kentcdodds.com/blog/fix-the-slow-render-before-you-fix-the-re-render'>Fix the slow render before you fix the re-render</Resource>
	- Understand that ES6 is <Resource url='https://javascript.info/event-loop'>single-threaded</Resource>, therefore laggy behavior can happen easily
		- Offload expensive work that shouldn't block rendering to <Resource url='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers'>Web Workers</Resource>

2. Fixing Profuse Re-Renders 
	- Use <Resource url='https://react.dev/learn/referencing-values-with-refs'>Refs</Resource> for state & values that <Resource url='https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/11/react-useref-hook/'>shouldn't cause re-renders</Resource> (or that aren't rendered at all)
	- Be careful of setting state in an effect or outside of event-handlers / conditions


***Memoization & Virtualization*** can solve slow renders or profuse re-renders in different ways:

- use <Resource url='https://react.dev/reference/react/memo'>memo</Resource> to memoize components and cut down pointless re-renders of child components when their props aren't changing
	- You should probably use `memo()` around any component immediately under <Resource url='https://alexsidorenko.com/blog/react-render-context/'>Context Provider</Resource>
	- See `memo()` in action with a <Resource url='https://codesandbox.io/s/a-visual-guide-to-react-rendering-sandbox-td70u?file=/src/sandbox.jsx'>visual example</Resource>
- use <Resource url='https://react.dev/reference/react/useMemo#usememo'>useMemo()</Resource> to memoize specific work *within* your components, cutting down the render time by skipping it if the recalculation isn't needed
	- <Resource url='https://alexsidorenko.com/blog/react-render-usememo/'>A Visual Guide to React Rendering - useMemo</Resource>
- use <Resource url='https://react.dev/reference/react/useCallback'>useCallback()</Resource> to memoize (cache) functions that are created for use in your components, cutting down the render time by skipping it if the function doesn't need to be recreated
	- <Resource url='https://alexsidorenko.com/blog/react-render-usecallback/'>A Visual Guide to React Rendering - useCallback</Resource>
- use <Resource url='https://www.patterns.dev/posts/virtual-lists'>virtualization</Resource> for efficiently rendering <Resource url='https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-window'>large lists of datasets</Resource>, cutting down render time
	- A library called <Resource url='https://million.dev/'>Million.js</Resource> has been making the rounds lately, apparently able to replace the VDOM in React with a version that's up to ***70% faster***.
	
## UX Performance Best Practices

- Consider throttling/debouncing frequent updates in the DOM. Humans can't see/process more than a few subtle updates in 1 second (1000 milliseconds), so there's no computational need to update something 100's of times per second.
	- Read more about <Resource url='https://www.nngroup.com/articles/too-fast-ux/'>how fast of an interaction is too fast</Resource> for humans
	- For actual changes in the UI/data that's being shown, try not to show more than 4-5 updates per second. Any more, and the humans using your app won't even be able to tell the difference between each update, making it pointless.
	- <Resource url='https://rxjs.dev/'>RxJS</Resource> has traditionally been a great resource for throttling data throughput in a JS application
	- Treat loading/pending states that are active for < 400ms uniquely, you should do either:
		- Simply don't show the loading state, as "delay" in the app that's < 400ms probably won't be perceivable by the users anyways
		- If you show the loading/pending state - require a minimum of ~400ms before switching back to a non-loading state
