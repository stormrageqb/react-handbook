# About the React Handbook

ðŸ‘‹ Hey there

My name is <Resource url='/team/eric-diviney/'>Eric</Resource>, and I created the initial version of this website I call the React Handbook.

**My goal for this website** is to cover the very nuanced details of working with React in production environments. 

I think this guide to opinionated React practices is necessary because the core React team can't and shouldn't focus too much of their time trying to cover the ecosystem in the docs (especially without showing favoritism).

The things I think are particularly important to know about working with React, I'll try to cover here. Things like:
- the vast ecosystem (libraries, tools, etc.)
- recommended / recognizable best practices that scale for larger organizations working on a codebase
- high-quality educational material on the internet (courses, videos, articles, podcasts, training, etc.)
  - MOST of what we recommend/link to is free, but where I do recommend paid resources I clearly indicate it (and I do not receive commissions from the authors, I doubt they even know who I am)

**What you might call this guide**
- An opinionated guide to advanced React patterns and practices
- Some of the "Gaps" in the official React docs that other writers can explain well

## Looking for Help 

As of right now, I mostly curate the entire website and allow access on a case-by-case basis when it comes to significantly contributing content/material to the handbook (not just bugfixes/refactors and things we request in our Issues tab). The idea is that the more the community gets behind this idea and joins, the less I will be solely in charge of what is on the site. There will always need to be some degree of experienced curation, but my hope is that the community will grow to the point that it NEEDS to expand beyond just myself in order to have the best ideas and content.

I'm looking for people interested in contributing to a guide like this that can serve the community and be a resource for what I would call "Best Practices with React".

If you're interested, you can help me by:

1. **Validation that the topics covered and the recommended approaches generally are agreed upon as best practices by the community.** <br/> This is specifically helpful if you are an expert/experienced in a particular facet of development (styling/CSS as an example) - I'm not looking for people to read in detail the entire website, but more like skip to the spots where THEY also have expertise and tell me how I did or if you would change anything
2. **Provide feedback to me for sections that are confusing, over-explained, or still not clear by the end of an article.** <br/> This is helpful from the exact opposite lens as point #1 above - if you are an expert in different facets of development than what I try to cover, but you really need to understand something you haven't ever dove into (testing or state-management for example) it's very helpful to get feedback when you still did not understand a topic very well after going through our material
3. **Help me out with small or large <Resource url='https://github.com/ericdiviney/react-handbook/issues'>issues</Resource> encountered in the maintenance of this website.** <br/> While I don't expect anyone to clean up my dirty work, I have been logging "tasks" or things that need to get done that might not require a seasoned/expert opinion and are just generally related more to site maintenance. If you're looking for more of those green squares in your GH profile but can't find things to work on, well I'd greatly appreciate it with these tasks. Some examples might be things like typos/spell-checks or text formatting, while others might be more interesting such as large component refactors (more realistic to professional React development).

You'll notice there's not much in-depth original content on this website. We mostly write a summary of a feature/library and then link off-site to the documentation for you to go and learn that technology in detail.

_TLDR: We like pointing people in the right direction._

| Who are you and why should I trust that you know anything about React?      | Honestly, there's no official answer I can give to this. I'm not on the React core team, and I don't have any certifications around React development or anything like that. I've worked with web technologies for 10+ years, and have been building + shipping React applications for 8 of those years. I wanted to start some kind of project in public and thought why not share the knowledge I've accrued over the years and find a way to make it a guide that people can follow by referencing high-quality content-creators on the internet.
| Why would I read this instead of the React documentation?                   | We definitely recommend starting with the <Resource url='https://react.dev/'>Official React Documentation</Resource> before coming here, as it helps to learn to "think in React" before you set off to build an app. If you've never built a web app before there are some <Resource url='/fundamentals'>starting points</Resource> we can recommend, but this guide might be a little too advanced for you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| What is the goal of this guide?                                             | Essentially, to be the go-to bookmark for engineers building React applications. To create a community around the concept of scalable, maintainable React code and how to achieve it. Then, document it (hence, this guide).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| What was the initial need for this guide?                                   | I (<Resource url='/team/eric-diviney'>Eric Diviney</Resource>) worked at a consulting company where we built enterprise web apps and digital products for very large companies (brands like John Deere, Toyota, Pizza Hut, TopGolf very recognizable American corporations). Not everyone was required to know React - but the nature of enterprise consulting meant there were always projects we needed to staff, and therefore we always had engineers learning React at different times. There was no formal learning path for anyone to follow provided by the firm. I made the first version of this guide as a reference to bring as many people as possible up to speed with modern web development practices. |
