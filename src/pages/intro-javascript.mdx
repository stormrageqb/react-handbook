# Hi there!

Thanks for checking out the React Handbook. {{ className: 'lead' }}

Before you get started, you should understand the motivations behind building this website, and more specifically, who we had in mind when writing all of this great content.

## Who this guide is for

This website will be straightforward if you are familiar with the fundamental technologies used to build websites (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

Our guides frequently make assumptions that you have worked with browser API's (such as the DOM), es6, etcâ€¦ if those aren't the everyday technologies you work with - you may struggle with many concepts presented in this guide. 

*\* and that's ok! To help you get started in the right direction, you should start with the material below:*

- [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) - a good desk reference to keep bookmarked. Read completely for a high-level understanding of the language
- [Clean Code JavaScript](https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript) - how to write clean, simple, understandable javascript
- [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/) - the modern javascript tutorial
- [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript) - full stack javascript tutorial
- [Egghead.io](https://egghead.io/courses/learn-es6-ecmascript-2015) - ES6 tutorial (things introduced to JavaScript since 2015)
- [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#functional-programming) - covers myriad of topics such as object-oriented programming, functional programming, regular expressions, etc.
- [33 js concepts](https://github.com/leonardomso/33-js-concepts) - fun public repository with somewhat random but necessary concepts for you to be aware of
