# Ecosystem

<Details icon='contribute' label='Help us make this page better!'>
  Hi there, so we're looking for libraries and tools that can do the following:
  
  - useful things for 3d rendering / graphics / video-gaming in browsers
  - edge cases / difficult things to do in frontend apps
  - niche libraries that just REALLY fill out their use-cases
</Details>

React boasts a vast ecosystem of open-source libraries, plugins, and features that can help your team rapidly develop UIs and applications.

Generally, to make our list below, the library in question needs to have support and active development/maintenance. The rules are not strict, something like 100K+ weekly downloads on npm and a release within the last 6-12 months.
