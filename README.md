## Suggestions

To start a discussion about a particular idea you'd like to champion (or think we should be covering), please open an issue in our GitHub repository with the label `Question` or join us on Discord and start the conversation there.

## Opening Pull Requests

Fork the repo, open your PR's into `develop`. We plan releases on an ad-hoc basis, but generally they happen everytime we make content changes.

In general, we'll look at just about any pull request opened, but we'd really appreciate PR's that tackle [bugs/issues](https://github.com/ericdiviney/react-handbook/labels/good%20first%20issue).
