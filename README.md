**Suggestions**

To start a discussion about a particular idea you'd like to champion (or think we should be covering), please open an issue in our GitHub repository with the label `Question`. We will try to respond within 24 hours.

**Opening Pull Requests**

Our branching strategy is pretty basic. When making updates to the repository, please always branch from `develop` and create your pull requests (PR's) back into `develop` as well. When releases are ready, we will merge `develop` into `main` which gets deployed via our Vercel account.
