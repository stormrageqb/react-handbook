V2 of the site

## Larger content updates to wrap up v2 sprint

- add a "Coming soon" or "More to come" to put at the bottom of topic pages. State Management is a great example here, since we want to publish an advanced guide.
    - this should be just like the "You will learn" summary at beginning of pages, say that we're working on more material and we'd be open to contributions
    - hooks
    - state management
    - automated testing
    - ecosystem (always adding)

Pages to be updated/modernized with the new components:
- Project standards
- Styling and UI libs
- hooks guide
- state Management
- performance
- testing
- clean up all frameworks pages

- check every page for hydration / errors








## Longer initiatives to add to the pipeline or to Github issues tab

1. Migrate all files to TypeScript
2. Add more structures to the file explorer (and link directly to the inspiration)

3. Add more file templates to project standards page (Context providers, quick-n-dirty global state with useContext/useState, barrel files and explanation, currying for tons of providers, custom hooks, higher order components, unit/integration/e2e test templates, other stuff?)
4. Add a new page near component templates - Random component tips and tricks:
    - using key={} to reset state for a component
5. Add a link in the footer, only visible on localhost, that opens a new page that demonstrates all the UI components on the site and provides the ts props interface for each
