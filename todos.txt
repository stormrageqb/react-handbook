V2 of the site

## Larger content updates to wrap up v2 sprint

- Work on SPA, Next, Remix, and Alternatve Tech Stacks page
    - remix page - include links to tutorials, kent c dodds, ryans series on twitter right now (building complex UI stuff)
    - nextjs - nextjs weekly newsletter, video courses anywhere around the internet, subreddits, docs, idk what else
    - https://github.com/vitejs/awesome-vite
- create an "Other Stacks w/ React" page also under "Frameworks" - this is where you recommend LiveWire, Laravel, Rails, Flask, Astro***
- find somewhere to put tamagui.js and NX monorepo for native/web shared codebases
- Vite backend integration resources - https://github.com/vitejs/awesome-vite#integrations-with-backends
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30LWjhZzg50
- add a <Summary> to the top of each content page
- check every page for hydration / errors
- use LeadHeadings inside <Details> and <Summary> where you need headers
- Looking for contributions on Ecosystem page
    - useful things for 3d rendering
    - edge cases / difficult things to do in frontend apps
    - niche libraries that just REALLY fill out their use-cases
    - add toast section to this page?
- New resources in the sidebar - Starter File Templates (Components, Contexts, Tests, etc.)
    - JavaScript / TypeScript component starter file
    - Barrel files
    - JavaScript / TypeScript context starter files / templates
        - what are the cute little variants with useState() that make it a simple global state?
    - JavaScript / TypeScript custom hook starter file
    - Test with custom render, context provider, components, and test assertations
    - component design patterns (HOC, etc.)
- Add a components/storybook like screen with examples of everything (link in footer, not header or sidebar with code samples)
- add a "Coming soon" or "More to come" to put at the bottom of topic pages. State Management is a great example here, since we want to publish an advanced guide.
    - this should be just like the "You will learn" summary at beginning of pages, say that we're working on more material and we'd be open to contributions

Pages to be updated/modernized with the new components:
- Project standards
- Styling and UI libs
- hooks guide
- state Management
- performance
- testing


## Longer initiatives to add to the pipeline or to Github issues tab

1. Migrate all files to TypeScript
2. Add more structures to the file explorer (and link directly to the inspiration)

    4/4 from this one: https://twitter.com/_georgemoller/status/1678374278511697920?s=20
3. Add more file templates to project standards page (Context providers, currying for tons of providers, custom hooks, higher order components, other stuff?)
