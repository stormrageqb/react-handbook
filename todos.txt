V2 of the site

## Larger content updates to wrap up v2 sprint

- file explorer and add more folder structures 
    - Josh Comeau has a nice minimal version you can draw some inspiration from: https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/file-structure/#the-implementation-3
    - https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-folder-structure/
    - https://blog.webdevsimplified.com/2022-07/react-folder-structure/
    - 4/4 from this one: https://twitter.com/_georgemoller/status/1678374278511697920?s=20

- Add a new section for each popular CSS library and some resources/tips for it:
    - tailwind
        - https://twitter.com/housecor/status/1615790145751367712?s=20
        - https://tailwindui.com/
        - https://nextui.org/docs/guide/introduction
        - https://preline.co/index.html
        - shadcdn component library
        - tailwind plugins for vscode
    - https://github.com/emilkowalski/sonner
- remember to make (coming soon) links for SPAs, Remix, Next.js, Gatsby
    - remix page - include links to tutorials, kent c dodds, ryans series on twitter right now (building complex UI stuff)
    - nextjs - nextjs weekly newsletter, video courses anywhere around the internet, subreddits, docs, idk what else
    - https://github.com/vitejs/awesome-vite
- create an "Other Stacks w/ React" page also under "Frameworks" - this is where you recommend LiveWire, Laravel, Rails, Flask, Astro***
- find somewhere to put tamagui.js and NX monorepo for native/web shared codebases
- Vite backend integration resources - https://github.com/vitejs/awesome-vite#integrations-with-backends
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30LWjhZzg50
- add a <Summary> to the top of each content page
- check every page for hydration / errors
- use LeadHeadings inside <Details> and <Summary> where you need headers
- Looking for contributions on Ecosystem page
    - useful things for 3d rendering
    - edge cases / difficult things to do in frontend apps
    - niche libraries that just REALLY fill out their use-cases
    - add toast section to this page?
- New resources in the sidebar - Starter File Templates (Components, Contexts, Tests, etc.)
    - JavaScript / TypeScript component starter file
    - Barrel files
    - JavaScript / TypeScript context starter files / templates
        - what are the cute little variants with useState() that make it a simple global state?
    - JavaScript / TypeScript custom hook starter file
    - Test with custom render, context provider, components, and test assertations
    - component design patterns (HOC, etc.)
- Add a components/storybook like screen with examples of everything (link in footer, not header or sidebar with code samples)
- add a "Coming soon" or "More to come" to put at the bottom of topic pages. State Management is a great example here, since we want to publish an advanced guide.
    - this should be just like the "You will learn" summary at beginning of pages, say that we're working on more material and we'd be open to contributions

Pages to be updated/modernized with the new components:
- Project standards
- Styling and UI libs
- hooks guide
- state Management
- performance
- testing


## Longer initiatives to add to the pipeline or to Github issues tab
- migrate to typescript bro
- "Detail" mode near dark/light mode - which defaults to all expandable components open by default (get this in cookie, localstorage?)
- refactor tabs to use headless ui instead of Radix - does this change much?
- refactor accordion -> disclosure in headless ui instead of Radix
- add a "sign up for newsletter to get updates" form somewhere
- also add ways to get people's attention, global CTA's pointing to new pages "Hey, we just published a new page on {x}, check it out ->"
- add a "Special Thanks" on the about page from me:
    - Josh Claunch, frequent collaborator and gives great feedback (also has expertise in very fast moving data in React apps)
